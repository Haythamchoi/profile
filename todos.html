THINGS TO FIX


BANNER
- Style up the banner a bit more (gradient or background image if you intend on it taking up most of the screen)
- If you want it to be very bannery, maybe make the p a litter shorter, or just omit it altogether
- Make the banner more mobile-friendly (Especially the H1)

CARDS
-Change the titles and whatnot in the cards(probably knew that already, but just reminding ya!)

MAP
-The map and cards are sliiightly not aligned, i didnt have time to fix it :(
